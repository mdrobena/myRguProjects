<h2>The History of Cheese</h2>
<p>The history of cheese predates recorded history. The origin of cheese is assumed to lie in the practice of
    transporting milk in bladders made of ruminants' stomachs, with their inherent supply of rennet. There is no
    conclusive evidence indicating where cheese-making originated, either in Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East
    , or Sahara. Cheese-making had spread within Europe at the earliest level of Hellenic myth[1] and, according to
    Pliny the Elder, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time ancient Rome came into being,[2] when valued
    foreign cheeses were transported to Rome to satisfy the tastes of the social elite.</p>

<p>Cheese making may have begun independently by the pressing and salting of curdled milk in order to better preserve it.
    Observation that the effect of curdling milk in an animal stomach gave more solid and better-textured curds may have
    led to the deliberate addition of rennet.</p>
